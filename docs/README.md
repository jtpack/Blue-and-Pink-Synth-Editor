# DOCS README

Blue and Pink Synth Editor's reference manual is written using Scrivener. 

As changes and new features are added to Blue and Pink Synth Editor, we
update the Reference Manual Scrivener document and commit a zipped copy
of the document to the repository.

When a new version of Blue and Pink Synth Editor is released, we compile
the reference manual into a pdf file (and possibly other formats, like html)
and place it here in the docs directory.

Note:
A Scrivener document is actually a folder containing lots of non-text files, so 
git's version control features are not effective on it. We zip up the file before
committing it to the repository because we might as well treat it like a black box,
and to save space.

All of this means that if more than one person makes changes to their local copies
of the Scrivener document then we will need to reconcile the changes manually.
